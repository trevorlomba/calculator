# Basic Calculator by Trevor Lomba

A basic calculator built using jQuery and styled via CSS. As this was one of my first coding projects, I actually reasoned out the logic used to return accurate calculations myself. A creative feature I am most proud of is how the appearance of the operands, operators, answers, and past equations all change as new inputs are selected, depending on their new status in the user interface.

Future updates will include an improved aesthetic and event listeners for keyboard inputs, plus data validation to protect against SQL injections and other threats.
